Tinos was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing serif design that is metrically compatible with Times New Romanâ„¢. Tinos offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability across platforms.

Updated in May 2013 with improved hinting and released under the Apache 2.0 license.
